## **Background**

Yes, you can use the very cool Chrome extension [Redux DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en) with [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). You may have bumped into lots of articles that say one of the downsides of using React Hooks with useReduce and useState, instead of react-redux is that you loose the awesome development experience that comes with react-redux. Well, thatâ€™s just wrong. Using the npm package `reinspect` you can see state changes.

Below is a the JavaSript and you can find the full github repo with this example here:

And the associated code is below. Notice how `useState` and `useReducer` are imported from `reinspect` and not `react`.

```js 
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

import { StateInspector, useState, useReducer } from "reinspect";

function CounterFunState() {
  const [sum1, setSum1] = useState(100, "Sum1State");
  return (
    <>
      {sum1}
      <button onClick={() => setSum1(sum1 + 1)}>Add 1 state</button>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>with useState</b>
    </>
  );
}

function CounterFunReducer() {
  const reducer = (state) => {
    return state + 5;
  };
  const [sum2, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, 5000, "Sum2State");
  return (
    <>
      {sum2}
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({})}>Add 5 reducer</button>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>with useReducer</b>
    </>
  );
}

function Counter() {
  return (
    <>
      <StateInspector name="App">
        <h1>StateInspector</h1>
        <CounterFunState /><br/><br/>
        <CounterFunReducer />
        <br/><br/>
      </StateInspector>
    </>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(<Counter />, document.querySelector("#root"));
```

There are just two things that you need to do in your code to make `useState` and `useReducer` work in your app.

1. You need to surround your components that include `useState` and `useReducer` with the `<StateInspector>` element.
2. You need to make sure that you import `useState` and `useReducer` from the npm package `reinspect` and not `react`.

That is. The chrome extension `redux-devtools` will now just work as you would expect.
