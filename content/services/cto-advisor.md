## Translating Truth from Hype

Truth be told, one of my superpowers is an internal BS meter. I’m able to translate techno-geek into integration strategies that drive business solutions. That’s why CTO’s tap into my experience with solution architecture and migration strategies. Having founded and built — from the ground up — a computer business that included custom software, sales, service, and training, I understand how legacy systems and new technologies fit together.

## An Objective CTO Advisor

When CTOs want an objective evaluation, they call me to:

* Weed through RFPs, user requirements, and system capabilities to determine what’s possible and what’s not
* Translate business requirements into migration plans
* Create clean specifications so teams have everything they need to achieve success

I have experience in:

* Building the architecture for full stack engineering
* Managing remote Engineering teams
* Creating training that memorializes institutional knowledge and standard operating procedures
* Authoring training courses covering JavaScript frameworks such as React and ExtJS, Microsoft web technologies, Node, SQL Server, Redis and others
* Organizing technical communities for educational and networking growth
